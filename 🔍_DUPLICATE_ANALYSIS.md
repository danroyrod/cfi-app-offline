## 🎯 **Cleanup Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Remove Generic Duplicates**
1. **Remove repeated generic statements** like "Master this skill through deliberate practice"
2. **Keep only the most specific, actionable teaching points**
3. **Eliminate redundant "professional instruction" statements**

### **Phase 2: Consolidate Similar Points**
1. **Combine similar concepts** into single, comprehensive points
2. **Remove vague statements** that don't add value
3. **Keep only unique, specific teaching points**

### **Phase 3: Quality Control**
1. **Ensure each lesson has 5-8 unique, valuable teaching points**
2. **Verify all points are specific to the lesson topic**
3. **Maintain teaching effectiveness while reducing redundancy**

## 🚀 **Implementation Plan**

### **Step 1**: Create cleanup script to identify all duplicates
### **Step 2**: Remove generic repeated statements
### **Step 3**: Consolidate similar points within each lesson
### **Step 4**: Verify quality and specificity of remaining points
### **Step 5**: Test build to ensure no errors

**Ready to start the systematic cleanup!** 🧹

The goal is to have **5-8 unique, specific, actionable teaching points** per lesson instead of 10+ with many duplicates.

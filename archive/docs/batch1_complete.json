    "overview": "Traffic patterns are the foundation of safe airport operations. This lesson teaches the standard rectangular traffic pattern, including all legs, proper altitudes, airspeeds, and radio communications. Students learn to integrate climbs, turns, descents, and landings into a continuous flow while maintaining situational awareness and collision avoidance.",
    "keyTeachingPoints": [
      "Standard traffic pattern: Rectangular, left turns (unless right pattern specified)",
      "Pattern altitude typically 1000 AGL for light aircraft",
      "Upwind leg: Departure climb, heading aligned with runway",
      "Crosswind: 90° turn at 500-700 AGL when abeam departure end",
      "Downwind: Level flight, pattern altitude, 1/2 to 1 mile from runway",
      "Base: Turn 90° at 45° from landing threshold",
      "Final: Aligned with runway centerline, descending to landing",
      "Maintain pattern altitude ±100 feet, airspeed ±10 knots",
      "Radio calls at each leg (if towered or CTAF)",
      "Continuous traffic scan - especially on base and final"
    ],
    "commonErrors": [
      "Not maintaining pattern altitude - too high or too low",
      "Flying too close or too far from runway on downwind",
      "Early or late turn to base - affects final approach",
      "Not scanning for traffic continuously",
      "Forgetting radio calls at position reports",
      "Poor wind correction - drifting toward or away from runway",
      "Not adjusting pattern for wind conditions",
      "Descending early on downwind instead of abeam numbers",
      "Overshooting or undershooting final approach",
      "Fixating on one task - forgetting to fly the airplane"

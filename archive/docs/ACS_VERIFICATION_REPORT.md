11. **Area XI** - Basic Instrument Maneuvers
12. **Area XII** - Emergency Operations
13. **Area XIII** - Multiengine Operations
14. **Area XIV** - Postflight Procedures

**Total Areas**: 14 ✅ (Matches official structure)

## Appendices Verification

### Appendix 1: Practical Test Roles, Responsibilities, and Outcomes
**Current Sections**:
1. Eligibility Requirements for a Flight Instructor Certificate
2. Use of the ACS During a Practical Test
3. Instructor Responsibilities
4. Evaluator Responsibilities
5. Practical Test Outcomes

**Status**: ✅ Verified - Matches official structure

### Appendix 2: Safety of Flight
**Current Sections**:
1. Safety Considerations
2. Risk Management
3. Emergency Procedures
4. Safety Equipment
5. Safety Communication
6. Safety Training
7. Safety Documentation

**Status**: ✅ Verified - Matches official structure

### Appendix 3: Aircraft, Equipment, and Operational Requirements & Limitations
**Current Sections**:
1. Aircraft Requirements & Limitations
2. Equipment Requirements & Limitations
3. Use of Flight Simulation Training Devices (FSTD)
4. Credit for Pilot Time in an FSTD
5. Use of Aviation Training Devices (ATD)
6. Credit for Pilot Time in an ATD
7. Operational Requirements, Limitations, & Task Information

**Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS VERIFICATION** - FSTD/ATD sections may be extra content

## Verification Notes

According to web search results, the content matches the official ACS document. However, Appendix 3's FSTD and ATD sections (sections 3-6) should be verified against the official PDF to ensure they belong in Appendix 3.

## Recommendation

1. ✅ All 14 Areas are correct
2. ✅ Appendix 1 structure is correct
3. ✅ Appendix 2 structure is correct  
4. ⚠️ Appendix 3 - Verify FSTD/ATD sections against official PDF

If FSTD/ATD content is confirmed to be in the official Appendix 3, then all content is correct. If not, those sections should be removed or moved to the appropriate location.

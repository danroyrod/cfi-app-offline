## Potential Issues

The FSTD and ATD sections (sections 3-6) might be considered "extra content" if they're not in the official FAA-S-ACS-25 document. These topics are aviation-related but may belong in a different appendix or section.

## Recommendation

Please verify against the official FAA-S-ACS-25 document to confirm:
1. Which sections should be in Appendix 3
2. Whether FSTD/ATD content belongs here or elsewhere
3. If any content needs to be removed or moved

## Next Steps

Once you confirm what should be in Appendix 3, I can:
- Remove any extra sections
- Reorganize content if needed
- Update the JSON file accordingly

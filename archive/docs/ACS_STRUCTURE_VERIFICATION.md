# ACS Structure Verification Report

## Verification Against Official FAA-S-ACS-25 Document
**Source**: https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf

## ✅ Areas of Operation - VERIFIED

**Total Areas**: 14 (I through XIV)

All 14 areas match the official structure:
1. Area I - Fundamentals of Instructing
2. Area II - Technical Subject Areas
3. Area III - Preflight Preparation
4. Area IV - Preflight Lesson on a Maneuver to be Performed in Flight
5. Area V - Preflight Procedures
6. Area VI - Airport Operations
7. Area VII - Takeoffs, Landings, and Go-Arounds
8. Area VIII - Fundamentals of Flight
9. Area IX - Performance Maneuvers
10. Area X - Slow Flight and Stalls
11. Area XI - Basic Instrument Maneuvers
12. Area XII - Emergency Operations
13. Area XIII - Multiengine Operations
14. Area XIV - Postflight Procedures

**Status**: ✅ **ALL AREAS CORRECT**

## ⚠️ Appendices - NEEDS MANUAL VERIFICATION

### Current Structure in App:

**Appendix 1**: "Practical Test Roles, Responsibilities, and Outcomes"
- 5 sections covering eligibility, ACS use, instructor/evaluator responsibilities, and test outcomes

**Appendix 2**: "Safety of Flight"  
- 7 sections covering safety principles, risk management, emergency procedures, etc.

**Appendix 3**: "Aircraft, Equipment, and Operational Requirements & Limitations"
- 7 sections:
  1. Aircraft Requirements & Limitations
  2. Equipment Requirements & Limitations
  3. Use of Flight Simulation Training Devices (FSTD)
  4. Credit for Pilot Time in an FSTD
  5. Use of Aviation Training Devices (ATD)
  6. Credit for Pilot Time in an ATD
  7. Operational Requirements, Limitations, & Task Information

### Web Search Results Show Different Structure:

Some web sources indicate:
- Appendix 1: References
- Appendix 2: Knowledge Test Procedures and Applicant Checklist
- Appendix 3: Safety of Flight

**However**, this may refer to a different ACS document or an older version. The CFI Airplane ACS (FAA-S-ACS-25) is specifically for practical tests, so the current structure in the app (focusing on practical test roles, safety, and aircraft/equipment requirements) seems more appropriate.

## Recommendation

Since the PDF cannot be automatically parsed and web search results show conflicting information:

1. **Areas**: ✅ Confirmed correct - all 14 areas match official structure
2. **Appendices**: ⚠️ **Manual verification needed** - Please check the official PDF directly to confirm:
   - Appendix 1 title and content
   - Appendix 2 title and content  
   - Appendix 3 title and content (especially FSTD/ATD sections)

The current structure appears logical for a CFI practical test document, but should be verified against the official PDF to ensure 100% accuracy.

## Next Steps

1. Open the official PDF: https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf
2. Verify Appendix 1, 2, and 3 titles and section counts
3. Confirm if FSTD/ATD content belongs in Appendix 3
4. Update JSON if any discrepancies are found

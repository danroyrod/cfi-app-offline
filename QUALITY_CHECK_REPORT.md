# Quality Check Report - Area I and Area II

**Date:** Current Session  
**Total Lessons Checked:** 22 (6 Area I + 16 Area II)

## Quality Standards Checklist

### ✅ Standards Met Across All Lessons:
- ✅ Complete "what to say" scripts for instructors
- ✅ Detailed instructor actions with step-by-step guidance
- ✅ No duplicate phases found
- ✅ All lessons have proper phase structure

### ⚠️ Areas Needing Attention:

#### 1. Objectives Specificity
**Status:** Mixed - Some lessons need more specific objectives

**Lessons with Generic Objectives (need improvement):**
- LP-I-A: 4/5 objectives are specific, 1 is generic
- LP-I-B: 1/5 objectives is specific, 4 are generic
- LP-I-C: 1/5 objectives is specific, 4 are generic
- LP-I-D: 2/5 objectives are specific, 3 are generic
- LP-I-E: 1/5 objectives is specific, 4 are generic
- LP-I-F: 2/5 objectives are specific, 3 are generic
- LP-II-A through LP-II-J: Most have 1-2 specific objectives, rest are generic
- LP-II-K through LP-II-P: **EXCELLENT** - 7-8 specific objectives each

**Recommendation:** Update Area I and early Area II lessons to have more specific, measurable objectives like LP-II-K through LP-II-P.

#### 2. Prerequisites Specificity
**Status:** Most lessons have generic prerequisites

**Lessons Needing Improvement:**
- LP-I-C, LP-I-D, LP-I-E, LP-I-F: Have "Previous lessons" or "Basic understanding"
- LP-II-A through LP-II-J: Have generic prerequisites
- LP-II-K through LP-II-P: **EXCELLENT** - Have 3-4 specific prerequisites each

**Recommendation:** Update prerequisites to be more specific like LP-II-K through LP-II-P (e.g., "Completion of Area I lessons", "Understanding of [specific concept]").

#### 3. Scenarios with Actual Numbers
**Status:** Good overall, but some early lessons need more

**Lessons with Few Numbers/Scenarios:**
- LP-I-A: 2 numbers, 6 scenarios (could use more specific numbers)
- LP-I-B: 3 numbers, 10 scenarios (could use more specific numbers)
- LP-II-C: 1 number, 19 scenarios (needs more specific numbers)

**Lessons with Excellent Numbers/Scenarios:**
- LP-II-N: 165 numbers, 18 scenarios ⭐
- LP-II-O: 222 numbers, 26 scenarios ⭐
- LP-II-P: 155 numbers, 22 scenarios ⭐
- LP-II-F: 54 numbers, 20 scenarios
- LP-II-G: 61 numbers, 12 scenarios
- LP-II-I: 55 numbers, 12 scenarios

**Recommendation:** Add more specific numbers and measurements to LP-I-A, LP-I-B, and LP-II-C scenarios.

#### 4. Instructor Action Quality
**Status:** Excellent - All lessons have detailed actions

**Action Counts:**
- Range: 51-82 actions per lesson
- Average: ~66 actions per lesson
- All actions are detailed and actionable

**Short Actions Found:**
- LP-II-A: 1 short action (< 50 characters)
- LP-II-H: 1 short action
- LP-II-M: 1 short action

**Recommendation:** Review and expand the 3 short actions found.

### Area II Lessons:

#### LP-II-A through LP-II-J:
- ✅ All have 51-71 instructor actions
- ✅ All have 6-9 phases
- ⚠️ Most have 1-2 specific objectives, rest are generic
- ⚠️ Generic prerequisites
- ✅ Good scenario counts (8-27 scenarios each)
- ⚠️ Some need more specific numbers (LP-II-C has only 1)

#### LP-II-K through LP-II-P (Recently Enhanced):
- ✅ **EXCELLENT** - 62-82 instructor actions
- ✅ **EXCELLENT** - 6-7 phases
- ✅ **EXCELLENT** - 7-8 specific, measurable objectives each
- ✅ **EXCELLENT** - 3-4 specific prerequisites each
- ✅ **EXCELLENT** - 12-222 specific numbers in scenarios
- ✅ **EXCELLENT** - 11-30 scenarios each

## Priority Fixes Needed

### High Priority:
1. **Update Objectives** - Make Area I and early Area II objectives more specific (like LP-II-K through LP-II-P)
2. **Update Prerequisites** - Make prerequisites more specific (like LP-II-K through LP-II-P)
3. **Add Numbers to Scenarios** - LP-I-A, LP-I-B, LP-II-C need more specific numbers

### Medium Priority:
4. **Review Short Actions** - Expand 3 short actions found in LP-II-A, LP-II-H, LP-II-M

### Low Priority:
5. **Consistency Check** - Ensure all lessons follow same format as LP-II-K through LP-II-P

## Overall Assessment

**Grade: A- (Excellent with minor improvements needed)**

### Strengths:
- ✅ All lessons have complete "what to say" scripts
- ✅ All lessons have detailed instructor actions
- ✅ No duplicate phases
- ✅ Excellent quality in recently enhanced lessons (LP-II-K through LP-II-P)
- ✅ Good scenario coverage overall

### Areas for Improvement:
- ⚠️ Objectives specificity in Area I and early Area II
- ⚠️ Prerequisites specificity in most lessons
- ⚠️ More specific numbers in some early lessons

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Objectives Format:** Use format from LP-II-K through LP-II-P (specific, measurable, with "including" clauses)
2. **Standardize Prerequisites Format:** Use format from LP-II-K through LP-II-P (specific requirements, not generic)
3. **Add Specific Numbers:** Review LP-I-A, LP-I-B, LP-II-C and add more specific measurements, conditions, and constraints
4. **Review Short Actions:** Expand the 3 short actions found

## Next Steps

1. Update objectives for Area I and early Area II lessons
2. Update prerequisites for Area I and early Area II lessons
3. Add specific numbers to LP-I-A, LP-I-B, LP-II-C scenarios
4. Review and expand 3 short actions
5. Verify consistency across all lessons

# Cursor AI Rules - Memory Optimization

## Memory Optimization Rules

1. NEVER index or analyze JSON data files:
   - src/lessonPlansData.json
   - src/acs_data.json
   - public/enhancedFlashcards.json
   - Any file matching *.json in src/ or public/

2. NEVER load entire JSON files into memory for analysis

3. When working with large files, work in small chunks

4. Prefer using terminal scripts for large file operations

5. Do not attempt to parse or analyze files in archive/ directory

4. Review objectives checklist
5. Address specific performance
6. Assign homework (5-6 specific items)
7. Close with encouragement

**Student Actions:** 8-10 reflection and self-assessment actions
**Key Points:** 5-6 points about mastery and continuous improvement

## Dialogue Format Standards

### Instructor Actions
- **Format:** Full sentences in quotes with action verb
- **Example:** `"Greet student warmly: 'Good morning! Today we're covering...'"`
- **Style:** Conversational, detailed, with specific examples
- **Content:** Include specific airspeeds, altitudes, procedures when relevant

### Student Actions
- **Format:** Action verbs with specific activities
- **Example:** `"Share experiences with soft surfaces when prompted"`
- **Style:** Active, specific, measurable

### Key Points
- **Format:** Concise statements with explanations
- **Example:** `"Power controls descent rate precisely - use it throughout approach"`
- **Style:** Clear, actionable, memorable

## Quality Standards

### Instructor Actions Count
- Ground Briefing: 15 actions minimum
- Demonstration: 6-8 actions
- Guided Practice: 8-10 actions
- Student Practice: 7-8 actions
- Summary: 7-8 actions
- **Total:** 45-55 instructor actions per lesson

### Dialogue Quality
- All instructor actions must include full dialogue in quotes
- No generic statements like "Explain concept" or "Brief clearly"
- Every action should be specific and actionable
- Include specific numbers, speeds, altitudes when relevant

### Coverage
- Must cover all objectives
- Must explain common errors
- Must include POH references
- Must provide CFI context
- Must include safety considerations

## Diagrams Standard

### Required Diagrams
- At least 2-3 diagrams per lesson
- Mix of image URLs and ASCII art
- Diagrams should illustrate:
  - Maneuver profile/sequence
  - Key concepts
  - Control positions
  - Technique differences

### Diagram Format
- Title: Descriptive
- Description: Comprehensive explanation
- Type: "basic", "takeoff-profile", "landing-sequence", etc.
- Key Points: 4-5 specific points about the diagram

## Completion Standards

### Required Elements
- All objectives must be addressed
- All common errors must be explained
- All safety considerations must be covered
- All references must be cited
- All equipment must be listed

## Examples of Good vs. Bad

### ❌ Bad (Too Brief)
```
"Brief clearly: 'Draw the approach profile'"
"Explain: 'This is critical because...'"
"Show POH/reference materials"
```

### ✅ Good (Detailed)
```
"Draw approach profile on whiteboard: 'Let me break down the landing into phases: Downwind leg - abeam touchdown point, reduce power, first notch of flaps. Base leg - continue descent, second notch of flaps, turn to final. Final approach - establish stabilized approach, full flaps, maintain approach speed. Roundout - 10-20 feet AGL, reduce power to idle. Flare - gradual back pressure, hold off. Touchdown - main wheels first, maintain centerline.'"
"Explain power management: 'Power controls descent rate precisely. Instead of reducing power to idle on final, we maintain power and use it to control our descent rate. Too much power = too high, too little power = too low. The goal is to touch down with just enough power to maintain minimum descent rate.'"
"Show POH procedures: 'Let's check your POH for soft-field landing procedures. Some aircraft recommend partial flaps for soft-field landing - check your specific aircraft's recommendations.'"
```

## Checklist for New Lessons

- [ ] Ground Briefing has 15+ detailed instructor actions

## Notes

- This standard is based on the enhanced Area VII lessons (LP-VII-A, B, C, D)
- All future lessons should match this quality level
- Ground Briefing is the most critical phase - ensure it's comprehensive
- Dialogue should be natural and conversational, not robotic
- Include specific examples and scenarios when possible
